Quick and dirty long running send to/download from Dropbox script

What it can do:
- Upload a folder & everything inside it (and optionally delete everything from the local disk)
- Monitor a remote folder for changes
- Download a folder & everything inside it (and optionally delete everything from Dropbox)

Use cases:
- Pushing daily database backups to a Dropbox folder (server to Dropbox)
- Pushing photos to a server from Dropbox (Dropbox to server)

It mostly works - have some error handling, but it's not production ready (and likely won't ever be...)
